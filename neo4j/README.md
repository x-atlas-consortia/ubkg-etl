# UBKG
## neo4j folder

**This folder does not contain an neo4j instance; instead, it
holds CSV files that can be used to create an instance.**

**These files should be excluded in a .gitignore file.**


The UBKG source and generation frameworks work with a set of 
CSV files that is intended to be the source of an import into a 
neo4j database. 

The **/import/current** path may contain multiple sets of CSV files.

For example, directories may include:

- a "UMLS only" directory that contains the set of CSV files generated by the source framework--i.e., extracted from the Neptune data mart.
- a "base set" directory of CSV files that represent the UMLS set, appended with ontologies that are common to all UBKG implementation.
- folders with names that start with "save", that are intermediate folders created in the generation framework workflow.


Eventually, the neo4j path should move to a Globus collection.
