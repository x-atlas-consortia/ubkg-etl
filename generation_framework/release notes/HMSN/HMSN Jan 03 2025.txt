RELEASE NOTES


UBKG CONTEXT
HuBMAP/SenNet

RELEASE DATE
03 January 2025

UPDATES

General
1. The UBKGSOURCES SAB was updated to reflect new versions and download dates of SABs. To view version information on
   a particular SAB, execute the sources endpoint of the ubkg-api.
2. Releases of UBKG contexts will henceforth include a set of release notes in this format.

Base context

1. UBERON, PATO, and CL are now ingested from the *_base.owl files (files without imports from other ontologies) to reduce duplicative interdependencies.
2. The ingestion order of UBERON and PATO was changed so that PATO is ingested before UBERON.

Context-specific

1. The UMLS content (part of the base UBKG context) was updated to reflect the UMLS 2024AB release.
2. All SAB sources of the base context were refreshed, including new downloads from OWL sources.
