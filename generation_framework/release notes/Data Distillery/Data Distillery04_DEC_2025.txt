UPDATES

General
Base context
1. This release is the second biannual update of 2025.
   The base context content was refreshed from new downloads of source data, starting
   with the 2025AB release of the UMLS.
2. The MONDO source owl was changed from the pan-species version (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo.owl)
   to the "MONDO simple release" version (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo/mondo-simple.owl). This was
   to limit MONDO data to human genes (https://github.com/x-atlas-consortia/ubkg-etl/issues/216).
