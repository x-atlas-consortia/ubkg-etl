Data Distillery
Changes made to source files for August 29 2025 release

Alan Simmons

Globus reorganization

As of July 2025, source files for Data Distillery SABs that use the UBKG Edge Node format are stored in
a folder in the Globus collection named HuBMAP Data.

Folder path: https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=24c2ee95-146d-4513-a1b3-ac0bfdb7856f&origin_path=%2Fprojects%2Fdata-distillery%2F

Source files for each SAB were moved into subfolders with names that correspond to the original file dates.

HSCLO

There are two versions of the node file for HSCLO--one with strings like "chr1" in the value column,
and one without strings. The UBKG import process assumes that the values in the value column of the node file
are of float (numeric) data type and so will not accept the version of the HSCLO node file with string values.

The version of the node file with string values is kept for archival, but should not be used for ingestion.

GTEXCOEXP

There are two versions of the GTEXCOEXP SAB source:
1. A "Complete" version
2. A "Condensed" version

The Data Distillery uses the "Condensed" version.

LINCS

Edge and node files in UBKG Edge Node format must be Text-Separated Variable (TSV) files.
Files can have either TSV or TXT file extensions. In particular, the UKBG ETL will fail to ingest CSVs.

During the July 2025 ingestion, I determined that the edge file for LINCS was actually a
Comma-Separated Variable (CSV) file. Before ingesting LINCS, I converted the CSV file to a true
TSV file.

MW

The UBKG ETL expects edge and node files to be named in a certain way. During the July 2025 ingestion,
I discovered that the node file for MW was misspelled (OWLNETS_node_metada.tsv).
