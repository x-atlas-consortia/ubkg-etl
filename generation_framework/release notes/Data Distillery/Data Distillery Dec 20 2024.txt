UPDATES

General
1. The UBKGSOURCES SAB was updated to reflect new versions and download dates of SABs. To view version information on
   a particular SAB, execute the sources endpoint of the ubkg-api.
2. Releases of UBKG contexts will henceforth include a set of release notes in this format.

Base context

1. UBERON, PATO, and CL are now ingested from the *_base.owl files (files without imports from other ontologies) to reduce duplicative interdependencies.
2. The ingestion order of UBERON and PATO was changed so that PATO is ingested before UBERON.

Specific
1. The ERCCRBP SAB uses the smaller version (May 2024) of the edge file, provided by ERCC.
2. The GTEXCOEXP file uses the larger version of its edge and node files.
3. Starting with this release, the Data Distillery context will include the SABs of the HuBMAP/SenNet context.
