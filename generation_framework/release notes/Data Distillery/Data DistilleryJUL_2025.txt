RELEASE NOTES

UBKG CONTEXT
Data Distillery

RELEASE DATE
July 2025

UPDATES

General

1. The UBKGSOURCES SAB was updated to reflect new versions and download dates of SABs. To view version information on
   a particular SAB, execute the sources endpoint of the ubkg-api.
2. A fulltext index was created for Term nodes to support fuzzy text searches.

Base context

1. The UMLS content (part of the base UBKG context) was updated to reflect the UMLS 2025AA release.
2. The base context content was refreshed from new downloads of source files, calls to APIs, etc.
3. UNIPROTKB
   a. UNIPROTKB now includes GO annotations for proteins.

       The three GO columns in the UniProtKB stream download correspond to values from the three
       Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) ontologies.
       (The GOA itself has a higher resolution for the Cellular Component aspect, but UniProtKB
       groups annotations only at the level of aspect.)

   b. The UNIPROTKB content in UBKG was expanded to include mouse proteins.
4. REACTOME
   a. The REACTOME ingestion was significantly refactored so that the UBKG both aligns with the REACTOME pathway
      event model and contains accurate information regarding reaction participants. For details of the schema
      of REACTOME data in the UBKG, refer to
      https://github.com/x-atlas-consortia/ubkg-etl/blob/main/generation_framework/reactome/README.md
   b. The REACTOME content in UBKG was expanded to include mouse pathways.
5. UMLS NOCODE code nodes were removed from the UBKG. The UMLS uses codes with ID NOCODE as placeholders for
   codes mapped to Metatheaurus concepts that are not mapped to a code in any of the UMLS source vocabularies.
   Six NOCODE codes in the UBKG are linked to over 542,000 Concept nodes.

   a. EMAPA - Mouse Developmental Anatomy Ontology
   b. EMAP-UBERON
2. Updated SABs:
