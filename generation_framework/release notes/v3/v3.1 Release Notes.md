# Release Notes
## Universal Biological Knowledge Graph (UBKG)
### Generation Framework
### Version 3.1
September *, 2023

# 1. Code-CUI assignment revision

The generation script was erroneously assigning multiple codes to the same CUI.
[Details](https://github.com/x-atlas-consortia/ubkg-neo4j/issues/24)

# 2. RefSeq summaries for genes
The generation script can can now obtain summaries for genes from RefSeq.

# 3. UniProtKB function for proteins
The generation script can now obtain function for proteins from UniProtKB.

# 4. Standardized format for relationships

[Details](https://github.com/x-atlas-consortia/ubkg-etl/issues/91)
Relationships can now only contain:
- alphanumeric characters
- the underscore
- the dot

In particular, dashes are removed from relationships. This includes pre-processing of relationships from the UMLS.

# 5. SUI property removed from Term nodes and CSVs
Prior to v3.1 of the generation framework, Terms had both the **name** property (with the term string) and the **SUI** property. 
The SUI (Semantic Unique Identifier) is a construct of the UMLS that was carried through to the UBKG. For non-UMLS SABs, the SUI had been 
simply the base64-encoded version of **name**, and so was duplicative. In addition, because the
**name** property for Term nodes is unique, there is no need for a separate SUI.

The framework still refers to "SUI"; however, "SUI" is now essentially identical to "term". 
1. Term nodes no longer have a **SUI** property.
2. CSV files retain __SUI__ in their file names; however, the files no longer contain SUI columns.
