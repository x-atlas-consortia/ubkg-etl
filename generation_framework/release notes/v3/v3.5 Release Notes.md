# Bug Fixes

A bug was introduced as part of an enhancement to cast all relationship labels as lower case. 
Incomplete casting of all related data resulted in the loss of the translations of labels for relationships
that corresponded to IRIs in Relations Ontology. For example, an assertion between
a UBERON code and a CL code from a number of ingestions did not properly translate the
relationship for RO_0002160, or "only_in_taxon"

The script now correctly translates and casts as lowercase:
