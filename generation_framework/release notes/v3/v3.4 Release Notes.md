## HuBMAP/SenNet context

### AZ
Because the AZ SAB is undergoing significant enhancement, it has been removed from the base context. It will be ingested as part of each deployment (HuBMAP/SenNet, Data Distillery) 
until AZ is in maintenance.

# Source Updates
## AZ
The Azimuth-Cell Ontology mappings were revised considerably, including:
- new preferred terms and synonyms 
- some new cross-references to CL

In addition, AZ now contains mappings for Liver.

## CEDAR
CEDAR templates are now mapped to:
- HuBMAP dataset data types (soft assay types)
- HuBMAP provenance entity types (e.g., dataset)
