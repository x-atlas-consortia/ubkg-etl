## RefSeq ETL

The RefSeq ETL script extracts descriptions of genes from the NCBI Gene database via the EUtils API.
The total number of Gene entries is over 194K, and the NCBI EUtilities API tends to fail with 500 errors 
if the script requests all of them at once. 

The ETL now "chunks" through the full set of RefSeq entries--i.e., it works with subsets--e.g., from the 1st to the 50,000th, 
50,001st to the 100,0000th, etc. The INI file for the
script includes a configurable chunk size.
