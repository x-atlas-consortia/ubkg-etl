# Bug Fixes
## Deduplication of CSVs

[Reference](https://github.com/orgs/x-atlas-consortia/projects/1?pane=issue&itemId=38913188)

It was possible to ingest a SAB more than once into UBKG, which resulted in duplicate rows in 
the ontology CSVs. The generation script now explicitly removes duplicate rows from each CSV.

## Blank definitions

[Reference](https://github.com/x-atlas-consortia/ubkg-etl/issues/102)

If a node file used the string "None" in the **node_definition** column, the script created a definition with a blank value for DEF.
The script now removes blank definitions before generating Definition nodes.

# Changes to SABs
1. **ORDO**: By default, ORDO uses _Orphanet_ as SAB for nodes. The generation script changes the node SAB to ORDO to be consistent with the SAB for edges. [Reference](https://github.com/x-atlas-consortia/ubkg-etl/issues/99)
2. **GENCODE_ONT**, a valueset of nodes built to support GENCODE, was changed to **GENCODE_VS**. [Reference](https://github.com/x-atlas-consortia/ubkg-etl/issues/98)

# New/Revised Ingestions
1. The generation framework now supports the ingestion of edge/node files related to CEDAR templates.
2. The generation framework supports a new version of HRAVS, which uses new IRIs.
