[URL]
# REST call to download the UniProtKB data.
# The base URL is a REST call that downloads a subset of the available protein information as a TSV, compressed in
# a GZIP file. The URL can be built from the download page using the download feature.
# The REST call downloads the following minimal information:
#   Entry
#   Entry Name
#   Protein Names
#   Gene Names
#   Reviewed (distinguishes between manually-curated Swiss proteins and automatically-annotated TREMBL proteins)

[Organisms]
# The values are codes from UNIPROTKB that identify organisms.
# The script will loop through the list and concatenate to the base query to compile results for all uncommented values.
