# OWLNETS to CSV conversion script

This script:
* Obtains data from triple store information in OWLNETS format
* Appends data into the ontology CSVS that can be loaded into the UBKG neo4j database

This script is still referred to as "Jonathan's" script in references in build_csv.py.

## Archive folder
In earlier iterations of development, the OWLNETS-UMLS-GRAPH script was developed as a Jupyter notebook and then converted
to a pure Python script by means of the **transform.py** script.

The script was versioned by incrementing a number at the end of the filename.

Earlier versions of this script, along with the transform script, are in the Archive folder.
