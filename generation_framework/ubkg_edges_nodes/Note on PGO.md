# Note on PGO
PGO is a precursor SAB for GENCODE. 

The Pseudogene (PGO) ontology is available as a RDF file in [NCBO BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/pseudo). 
It has not been updated since 2008. 
I converted the RDF file to OWLNETS format and now simply use the OWLNETs files by running **./build_csv.py -s PGO**.
