# Obtain "edges and nodes" files to ingest an ontology (set of assertions) into the UBKG.
# The formats for the files are described in the UBKG user guide in the source repo.

# Unlike ontologies that are available as either OWL files or SimpleKnowledge format, the "edges and nodes"
# files will be downloaded manually and stored in the owlnets_output path.
